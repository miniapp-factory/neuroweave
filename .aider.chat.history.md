Concept: Voice-record dreams on wake-up; Grok weaves them into a evolving "dream graph" predicting patterns (e.g., "Recurring flying = unresolved ambition"). Generate lucid dream scripts or art from entries.
Key Features:Privacy-first: On-device processing + optional xAI cloud for deep analysis.
Weekly "dream forecast" with therapy tie-ins (e.g., CBT prompts).
Share anonymized patterns as X polls for collective insights.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values to match the new app concept.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo you want to generate.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it. The logo file can be created directly; I’ll give you the content for `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

A stylized dream cloud with a microphone inside, swirling with subtle pastel colors, symbolizing voice-recorded dreams. The cloud is semi-transparent, with a faint outline of a brain pattern inside, and a small glowing dreamcatcher at the bottom. The background is a gradient from midnight blue to deep purple, evoking nighttime and the subconscious.
